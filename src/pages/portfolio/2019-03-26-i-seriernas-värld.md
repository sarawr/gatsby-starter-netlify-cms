_Exhibition at Stockholm City Museum._\

With the use of motion sensors, we created adaptive music for this exhibition about Stockholm. We composed six pieces of music that adapted to the amount of people in the room.\
Music and Technical Installation by Hugo Lundgren, Christoffer Karlsson in collaboration with the Royal College of Music in Stockholm.
